# 🎮 Zeno’s Runner  
### An Interactive Visualization of Zeno’s Dichotomy Paradox

Zeno’s Runner is a high-performance HTML5 endless runner game built with Phaser 3 that visually demonstrates **Zeno’s Dichotomy Paradox** through gameplay.

Created for the International Math Expo.

## 🧠 The Mathematical Idea

Zeno’s Dichotomy Paradox states:

> To reach a destination, you must first travel half the distance.  
> Then half of the remaining distance.  
> Then half again.  
> This continues infinitely.

Mathematically, the infinite geometric series:

1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ... 

converges to:

= 1

But visually, the runner never appears to reach the goal.

This game transforms that philosophical paradox into an interactive mathematical experience.

## 🎮 Gameplay Concept

- You play as **Atalanta**, running toward a glowing goal.
- Every time you reach half the remaining distance:
  - The camera zooms in 2×
  - The character shrinks by 50%
  - A new "Layer of Infinity" is added
- Obstacles represent mathematical paradoxes.
- The score is measured in **Layers of Infinity**, not distance.

The goal is unreachable — by design.

## 🎓 Expo Demonstration Talking Point

When asked:

“Does the runner ever reach the goal?”

Answer:

Mathematically — yes (the series converges to 1).  
Visually — no (infinite steps prevent completion).  

That tension is the paradox.
